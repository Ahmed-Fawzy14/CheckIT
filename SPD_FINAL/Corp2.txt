There are various approaches to solving problems in programming and it is crucial to be able to utilize them when appropriate. Storing and looking for a set of data varies from structure to structure. In this paper, we will be comparing three different searching algorithms, which are hash lookup, breadth-first search, brute force search. These algorithms use different methods to look for a target element and, as a result, this affects the time complexity of each.
